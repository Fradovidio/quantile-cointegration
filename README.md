# quantile-cointegration
How to build a trading strategy using quantile cointegration.

A trading strategy is a method, a set of rules to be followed to invest in the financial market.  
A trading strategy includes the whole phase, from the beginning to the end of the investment, where to invest, when, how much money, whether to buy or sell short etc. 


In this case we will leave out some aspects (such as the capital to invest) and we will focus mainly on obtaining what is called 'operational signal' that tells us what to do: whether to buy or sell short and at what level.   

In this regard we will estimate two thresholds: an upper threshold and a lower threshold. 

That will serve us to understand if during the open market day, if the price of the index that I will present in a while, which oscillates in these two bands, should exceed the upper level then a buy signal is created, vice versa a sell signal is created
